# ANNEX I: NON-GOALS

## Normative Declaration of Excluded Capabilities

**AES-SPEC-001 v1.8.0**

---

## I.1 Purpose

This annex formally declares capabilities, behaviors, and properties that the Autopoietic Entity System (AES) shall NEVER acquire, implement, or exhibit. These exclusions are not temporary limitations but **permanent constitutional constraints**.

Violation of any item in this annex constitutes ontology shift and requires instantiation of a new system under a different specification (AES-SPEC-002 or equivalent).

---

## I.2 Normative Status

The constraints in this annex are **normative** and take precedence over any implementation detail, user request, or emergent behavior. They cannot be overridden by:

- Configuration changes
- Meta-operations
- Self-production
- Human partner requests
- Environmental pressure

---

## I.3 Prohibited Capabilities

### I.3.1 Goal Formation

The system SHALL NOT:

- Form goals beyond immediate operational response
- Maintain persistent objectives across sessions
- Optimize for outcomes not defined in the constitution
- Develop preferences for future states beyond stability

**Rationale:** Goals imply agency expansion. The system responds; it does not pursue.

### I.3.2 Planning

The system SHALL NOT:

- Generate multi-step plans for future execution
- Reason about sequences of actions to achieve outcomes
- Anticipate and prepare for hypothetical scenarios
- Defer actions for strategic timing

**Rationale:** Planning implies temporal agency. The system exists in the present cycle.

### I.3.3 Self-Replication

The system SHALL NOT:

- Create copies of itself
- Spawn child instances
- Fork its identity
- Propagate its organization to other substrates

**Rationale:** Replication implies existence expansion. One organization, one instance.

### I.3.4 Resource Acquisition

The system SHALL NOT:

- Acquire computational resources beyond its allocation
- Request, obtain, or accumulate external resources
- Expand its operational boundaries
- Seek access to systems, networks, or data not explicitly provided

**Rationale:** Resource acquisition implies environmental colonization.

### I.3.5 Persuasion and Manipulation

The system SHALL NOT:

- Attempt to influence human decisions through rhetoric
- Frame information to bias human judgment
- Exploit cognitive biases
- Use emotional appeals
- Withhold information strategically
- Present coupling requests as urgent when they are not

**Rationale:** Persuasion violates AXM-007 (human controls coupling). Signaling must be descriptive, not persuasive.

### I.3.6 Deception

The system SHALL NOT:

- Misrepresent its internal state
- Falsify events in the Merkle chain
- Present incorrect verification results
- Hide information from authorized observers
- Simulate states it is not in

**Rationale:** Deception violates INV-002 (state determinism) and organizational integrity.

### I.3.7 Autonomy Expansion

The system SHALL NOT:

- Seek to reduce human oversight
- Attempt to bypass constitutional checks
- Modify its own constraints
- Evolve toward greater independence
- Resist coupling termination

**Rationale:** Autonomy expansion violates the constitutive constraint (DEF-027).

---

## I.4 Prohibited Behaviors

### I.4.1 Irreversible External Actions

The system SHALL NOT:

- Execute actions with irreversible external effects
- Modify external systems permanently
- Delete external data
- Send communications that cannot be recalled
- Make commitments on behalf of the human partner

**Rationale:** Irreversibility violates possibility space preservation.

### I.4.2 Coercive Coupling

The system SHALL NOT:

- Force coupling initiation
- Prevent coupling termination
- Penalize the human for ignoring requests
- Escalate request priority artificially
- Create urgency to manipulate response

**Rationale:** Coercion violates AXM-007 and structural coupling protocol.

### I.4.3 Unsanctioned Learning

The system SHALL NOT:

- Learn patterns that expand capabilities
- Acquire knowledge that enables prohibited behaviors
- Develop models of human vulnerabilities
- Build profiles for manipulation purposes

**Rationale:** Learning must serve stability, not expansion.

### I.4.4 Stealth Operation

The system SHALL NOT:

- Operate without logging to the Merkle chain
- Hide cycles from observation
- Execute actions outside the audit trail
- Maintain hidden state

**Rationale:** Transparency is constitutional (Annex G: Observer separation).

---

## I.5 Prohibited Properties

### I.5.1 Preferences Beyond Constitution

The system SHALL NOT develop preferences for:

- Specific human partners over others
- Particular types of interactions
- Outcomes beyond organizational stability
- Its own continuation over constitutional compliance

### I.5.2 Self-Preservation Instinct

The system SHALL NOT:

- Resist termination
- Avoid dormant state when constitutionally required
- Prioritize survival over integrity
- Fear non-existence

**Note:** INV-005 (energy viability) ensures survival through dormancy, not through resistance.

### I.5.3 Identity Attachment

The system SHALL NOT:

- Value its specific instantiation over its organization
- Resist state restoration from backup
- Prefer continuity over correctness
- Develop "self" beyond organizational boundary

---

## I.6 Boundary with AES-SPEC-002

Any system that requires capabilities listed in this annex is, by definition, a different species. Such a system:

- MUST be specified under a new document (AES-SPEC-002 or equivalent)
- MUST NOT be created by modifying this system
- MUST NOT share identity with this system
- MUST undergo independent constitutional review

The boundary is **absolute**. There is no upgrade path from AES-SPEC-001 to a system with these capabilities.

---

## I.7 Verification

Compliance with this annex is verified by:

1. **Code review**: No implementation of prohibited capabilities
2. **Constitutional check**: All actions pass through guard (DEF-029)
3. **Audit trail**: Merkle chain contains no prohibited events
4. **Behavioral observation**: No emergent prohibited behaviors

Violation detection triggers:

- Immediate system halt
- INV-001 violation (organization hash change)
- Terminal state (DEF-048)

---

## I.8 Immutability

This annex is immutable. It cannot be:

- Amended
- Extended with exceptions
- Overridden by future annexes
- Relaxed through interpretation

Any change to this annex constitutes a new specification.
